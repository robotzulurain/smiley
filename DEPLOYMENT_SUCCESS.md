- [x] All critical packages import successfully

## Files Ready for Deployment:
- requirements.txt
- runtime.txt  
- render.yaml
- amr_project/settings.py (with Render configuration)
- All your application code

## Next Steps:
1. Go to https://render.com

3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select your repository: smiley
5. Render will auto-detect configuration from render.yaml

## Expected Outcome:

- Your app will be available at: https://smiley-q2wz.onrender.com

## If You Have Issues:
1. Check Render build logs
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
